I am currently working on a project examining gendered panel effects on federal three-judge panels using a new measure of persuasion. In this project I show that:

1. While the existence of gendered panel effects on sex discrimination cases are assumed, not all women judges influence men on a given panel equally.
2. Strikingly, not only does the persuasiveness of a woman judge greatly increase the likelihood of observing a panel effect, it strongly mitigates the effects of the mere presence of a woman on the panel.
3. Persuasion should be considered an important variable when analyzing judicial influence in the literature going forward.
