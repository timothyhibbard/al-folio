I am currently working on a project examining gendered panel effects on federal three-judge panels using a new measure of persuasion. A downloadable PDF of a working draft can be found <a href="/assets/presence or persuasion.pdf">here</a>.

You can download my latest Stata file <a href="/assets/panel.dta">here</a> and my .do file <a href="/assets/data1.do">here</a>.
