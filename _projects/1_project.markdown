I am currently working on a project examining gendered panel effects on federal three-judge panels using a new measure of persuasion. A downloadable PDF of a working draft can be found <a href="/assets/presence or persuasion.pdf">here</a>.

You can download my latest .r (R) files <a href="/assets/panel.r ">here</a> and my .do (Stata) file <a href="/assets/data1.do">here</a>.
