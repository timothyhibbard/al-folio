Working with the [Institute for Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR)](http://www.ippsr.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University, we conducted an experiment designed to test the effects of implicit and explicit gender cue ads on women. The goal was to invite members of a local community to a [Michigan Political Leadership Program (MPLP)](http://www.ippsr.msu.edu/political-leadership/michigan-political-leadership-program-mplp/about-mplp) event called Engage Battle Creek using different targeted Facebook ads. A downloadable PDF of my findings (general-audience overview) can be found <a href="/assets/facebooktext.pdf">here</a>.
