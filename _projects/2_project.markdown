Working with the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR) at Michigan State University, we conducted
an experiemnt designed to test the effects of implicit and explicit gender cue ads on women.
The goal was to invite members of a local community to a Michigan Political Leadership Program (MPLP)
event called Engage Battle Creek using different targeted Facebook ads. A downloadable 
PDF of the blog post can be found <a href="/assets/facebooktext.pdf">here</a>.

You can download a copy of the ad text and image <a href="/assets/facebookad.pdf">here</a> and the data <a href="/assets/fbdata1.do">here</a>.
