I conducted an experiemnt designed to test the effects of implicit and explicit gender cue ads on women.
The goal was to invite members of a local community to a Michigan Political Leadership Proogram (MPLP)
event called Engage Battle Creek using different targeted Facebook ads. A downloadable 
PDF of a working draft can be found <a href="/assets/Final.pdf">here</a>.

You can download a copy of the ads <a href="/assets/Facebookadtext/pic.pdf">here</a> and the data <a href="/assets/data1.do">here</a>.
