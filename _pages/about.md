My research interests are concentrated around gender and minority politics in legislative and judicial settings. Currently I am working on a project examining gendered panel effects on federal three-judge panels using a new measure of persuasion. A working draft can be found on the APSA conference website [here](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/apsa/apsa17/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=1246509&PHPSESSID=8st79g8ic5rr4ioo1sskmja1s4).

I earned my BS in Poltical Science at Boise state University as a [McNair Scholar](https://mcnairscholars.com/about/). Prior to my undergrad, I served five years on active duty in the United States Navy attached to to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) for 4 of those years, the other year I was attached to a Joint Service command in Ramadi (8 months) and Balad (4 months), Iraq.
